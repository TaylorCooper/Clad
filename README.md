#MieCalc#

Code for estimating scattered light intensity from particles with
different size, index of refraction and position relative to a receiving
photodiode

__MieCalc__:

_Input_: All input variables are assigned in the __init__ function
_Output_: Plot of amplitude functions and scattered intensity off of 
particle with give size and index of refraction.  Plot of integrated
intensity incident on photodiode for various particle / beam 
locations above the photodiode.
